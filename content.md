###[PicksKing Modded Texture Compilation v2.2](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=172740)
This one is a combination of the above two texture packs with some tweaks. Tries to take the best from both and combine it. Your mileage may vary.
###[BarWays Compilation](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=178494)
Same concept as the mod above it, except better, use this one if you don't know which one to pick.
